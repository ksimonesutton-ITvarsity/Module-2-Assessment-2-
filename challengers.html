                    Tashi, a tennis player turned coach, has transformed her husband from a mediocre player into a world-famous grand slam champion.</br>
                     To jolt him out of his recent losing streak, she makes him play a challenger event, close to the lowest level of tournament on the pro tour. Tensions soon run high when he finds himself standing across the net from the once-promising, now burnt-out Patrick, his former best friend and Tashi's former boyfriend.</p>
